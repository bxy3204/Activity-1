I am inserting my defects here for now as I do not have Word installed on my PC and would likely cause some formatting
issues. I will add the defects to the normal defect list at a later time

Test case 1 failure

//ToDo add screen cap of failing on positive and negative input

//ToDo solution in Inventory Line 182, should read:

//currently
		if (amtSugar <= 0) {
		
Defect 3: In Inventory useIngredients coffee is added to inventory instead of removed

Solution in Inventory Line 220 should read:
